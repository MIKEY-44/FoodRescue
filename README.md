# 🍽️ FoodRescue

FoodRescue is a **web application** built to tackle the problem of **food waste** by connecting people who have surplus food with those in need.  
The idea is simple: instead of throwing away extra food, donors can list it on the platform, and receivers (such as NGOs, shelters, or individuals) can request it.  

This creates a **community-driven system** to reduce food waste, help underprivileged people, and build awareness about sustainable living.
